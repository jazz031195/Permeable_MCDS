/*! \class Collisionspheren
 * \brief   Father class. this class provides methods in order to create and update
 *          spherical bounding box used to compute the collisions. The implementation
 *          is based on two collision spheres. The inner one (small) and the (outer).
 *          The fist saves the objects where th particle MAY collide in a given time,
 *          While the second saves the full set of obstacles where the particle can
 *          possibly collide, i.e. that are physically achievable for the walker to
 *          collide.
